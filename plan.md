## Development Notes

### Database Schema Changes

The initial implementation used static HTML content. The project now uses a dynamic SQLite database with the following structure:

```sql
-- Core resume data tables
CREATE TABLE profile (...);
CREATE TABLE experience (...);
CREATE TABLE education (...);
CREATE TABLE skills (...);
CREATE TABLE achievements (...);
CREATE TABLE projects (...);

-- Admin authentication
CREATE TABLE admin_settings (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### Authentication System

The admin authentication system replaced hardcoded credentials with database-stored values:
- Default credentials: username: "admin", password: "admin123"
- Credentials stored in `admin_settings` table
- Session-based authentication with timeout
- Password change functionality with validation

### Deployment Considerations

- Ensure the `data` directory has proper write permissions
- Initialize the database before first use
- Change default admin password immediately
- Consider adding .htaccess protection for sensitive files
